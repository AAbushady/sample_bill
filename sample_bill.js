Customers have complained that it is difficult for them to determine what they will 
have to pay when on the different plans. Corporate sales has decided to send 
potential customers a sample bill outlaying what they would pay under each different plan.

Write a program that will calculate and display a customer's monthly bill under
each plan. Assume the customer uses an average of 52 hours per month. 
For each of the plans show the amount of money they would pay under the plan.
For package A show how much money they would save if they purchased package B or C. 
For package B customers, show how much they would save if they purchased package C. 
If there would be no savings, no message should be printed.
